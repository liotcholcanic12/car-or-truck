# Car or Truck Image Classifier

This repository contains a deep learning model trained to classify images as either "car" or "truck."

**Dataset:**

The model was trained on a dataset of car and truck images sourced from Kaggle. 

**Limitations:**

* **Current Functionality:** The current implementation only classifies images as either "car" or "truck." It does not support any other vehicle types.
* **Colab Dependency:** The provided code is currently optimized for execution on Google Colaboratory and may require adjustments for other environments.

**Future Improvements:**

* **Expand Classification:** Extend the model to classify additional vehicle types (e.g., buses, motorcycles, bicycles).
* **Improve Accuracy:** Explore techniques like data augmentation, model architecture optimization, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy.
* **Deploy on a Local Machine:** Adapt the code to run locally on different operating systems.
* **Create a User-Friendly Interface:** Develop a more user-friendly interface with options for image selection, prediction visualization, and model evaluation.
